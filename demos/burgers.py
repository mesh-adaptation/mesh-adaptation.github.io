# Burgers equation on a sequence of meshes
# ========================================

# This demo shows how to solve the `Firedrake`
# `Burgers equation demo <https://firedrakeproject.org/demos/burgers.py.html>`__
# on a sequence of meshes using Pyroteus.
# The PDE
#
# .. math::
#
#    \frac{\partial\mathbf u}{\partial t}
#    + (\mathbf u\cdot\nabla)\mathbf u
#    - \nu\nabla^2\mathbf u = \boldsymbol0 \quad\text{in}\quad \Omega\\
#
#    (\widehat{\mathbf n}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf u
#    = \boldsymbol0 \quad\text{on}\quad \partial\Omega
#
# is solved on two meshes of the unit square,
# :math:`\Omega = [0, 1]^2`. The forward solution is initialised
# as a sine wave and is nonlinearly advected to the right hand
# side. See the Firedrake demo for details on the discretisation used.
#
# We always begin by importing Pyroteus. ::

from pyroteus import *

# In this problem, we have a single prognostic variable,
# :math:`\mathbf u`. Its name is recorded in a list of
# fields. ::

fields = ['uv_2d']

# First, we specify how to build a :class:`FunctionSpace`,
# given some mesh. Function spaces are given as a dictionary,
# labelled by the prognostic solution field names. The
# function spaces will be built upon the meshes contained
# inside an :class:`MeshSeq` object, which facilitates
# solving PDEs on a sequence of meshes.


def get_function_spaces(mesh):
    return {'uv_2d': VectorFunctionSpace(mesh, "CG", 2)}


# Pyroteus requires a solver with two arguments: the index
# within the :class:`MeshSeq` and a dictionary containing a
# starting value :class:`Function` for each prognostic solution.
#
# Timestepping information associated with the mesh within
# the sequence can be accessed via the :attr:`TimePartition`
# attribute of the :class:`MeshSeq`.
#
# The following pattern is used for the QoI, which will be
# specified later. The dictionary usage may seem cumbersome when
# applied to such a simple problem, but it comes in handy when
# solving adjoint problems associated with coupled systems of
# equations. It is important that the PDE solve is labelled
# with an ``options_prefix`` which matches the corresponding
# prognostic variable name. It is also important that the
# lagged solution field be given a name which is the field name,
# appended by ``'_old'``. ::

# condition from a function space. ::

    x, y = SpatialCoordinate(mesh_seq[0])

# Now that we have the above functions defined, we move onto the
# concrete parts of the solver, which mimic the original demo. ::

# subintervals. ::

# Finally, we are able to construct a :class:`MeshSeq` and
# solve Burgers equation over the meshes in sequence. ::

# Finally, we plot the solution at each exported timestep by
# looping over ``solutions['forward']``. This can be achieved using
# the plotting driver function ``plot_snapshots``.
